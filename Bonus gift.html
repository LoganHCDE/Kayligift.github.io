        Dear Kayli, 
    </p>

    <p>
        It has recently come to my attention that it is your birthday, and that I am indeed your boyfriend. Given these two painfully obvious facts, it also appears I’ve been saddled with the task of bestowing upon you a gift. Now, as a loving partner who consistently upholds a standard of moral fortitude, I have tried my hardest to resist, but alas, I have been thwarted by something far stronger than my ethics: your pretty face. It seems that no matter how hard I try, you’ve won me over, and I will be bowing to the forces of darkness that you so gleefully embrace.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yes, you, my dear, have chosen to dabble in the nefarious world of anime. As if your unrepentant fascination with these so-called “characters” and their “plots” weren’t bad enough, you’ve also managed to convert me into your personal anime benefactor. Well, congratulations—my moral compass is now spinning like a broken ceiling fan. I shall subsidize your wicked ways and support this hobby you hold so dear, for the sake of that lovely mug of yours that I simply cannot resist.
    </p>

    <p>
        Therefore, brace yourself for the final plunge into corruption: a full 12-month subscription to Crunchyroll, courtesy of your morally compromised boyfriend. Once you have finished reading this message and cackled at the defeat of my last remaining shred of pride, I shall set up the gift I purchased on your account and usher you into yet another year of animated madness. Happy birthday, my sweet anime enthusiast, and may the dark forces of cartoon lunacy be ever in your favor.
    </p>

    <p>
        I warn you, the punishment for defying my orders of secrecy on this matter is death, 
    </p>

    <p>
